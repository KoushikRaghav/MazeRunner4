# MazeRunner4
John(student) tries to escape from the college. There are many ways to escape. But he wants to find the shortest path to escape. Yay!! That’s our game’s goal. John traverses to all possible locations in college and finds the jump out locations. He runs to all the jump out paths and counts the number of steps and number of turns to escape. Finally, by comparing all the paths, John finds the shortest path and then escapes ASAP.To develop a Game which solves the maze and finds the optimal path to come out.This project aims at creating a full-fledged website Maze Solving by traversing from Source Path to destination path respectively. The technical and the commercial scope involved in developing and implementing the project has been discussed.
